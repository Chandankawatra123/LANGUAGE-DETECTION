# Multilingual Text Classification: Language Detection with Machine Learning Algorithms


## Description

Our project focuses on the development and comparison of machine learning models for accurate language detection in multilingual text data. Language detection is a crucial component in various applications, such as content filtering, language-specific services, and global customer support. By leveraging different machine learning algorithms, we aim to build a robust language detection system that excels in accuracy, efficiency, and adaptability.
