# Language Detection usind different ML algorithms


## Overview

This repository contains a project that implements a Multinomial Naive Bayes Machine Learning model to classify the text language from images. The model is trained on a dataset of newspaper snippets written in three different languages: English, Hindi, etc. The dataset is mixture of data obtained from Kaggle notebooks.

The goal of this project is to showcase how to extract text from images using Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and then use different algorithms to predict the language of the extracted text.
